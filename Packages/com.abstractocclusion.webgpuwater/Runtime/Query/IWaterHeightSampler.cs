// WebGpuWater - the public water-height query seam.
//
// A small, allocation-free façade so gameplay code (and buoyancy, and any future physics adapter)
// can ask "where is the water surface, which way is it tilted, how fast is it moving" at one or many
// world points WITHOUT reaching into WaterVolume internals. WaterVolume implements this directly.
//
// WebGPU-first: the implementation is CPU-analytic (the shared wave mirrors), so a batched query
// returns valid data from frame 0 with no async GPU readback - the readback path that Crest's query
// system depends on is unavailable on the deployed WebGPU build.
