// WebGpuWater - owner-keyed reusable buffers for batched water queries.
//
// A caller that samples the same points every frame (a floater's probes, a hull's sim vertices) should
// reuse one WaterSample[] rather than allocating each FixedUpdate. This registrar hands each owner its own
// grow-on-demand buffer, keyed by a stable owner id. It is the CPU analogue of Crest's per-caller query
// segments, minus the GPU readback ring buffer (our query path is CPU-analytic, so there is no latency to
// absorb). Main-thread only; not thread-safe.
