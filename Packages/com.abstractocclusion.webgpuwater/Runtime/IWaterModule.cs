// WebGpuWater - the module seam (Unity 6 / URP port).
//
// WaterVolume is being broken out of a god-class into a thin master that orchestrates optional,
// self-contained modules. IWaterModule is the lifecycle contract those modules share. Phase 1
// formalises the collaborators WaterVolume already owns (sim, obstacle, caustics, surface sampler,
// ocean FFT, sim window): the master constructs and disposes them through a registry instead of by
// hand. Per-frame Tick and uniform publishing are added to this contract in later increments, once
// the render/sim schedule is restructured with the editor in the loop.
