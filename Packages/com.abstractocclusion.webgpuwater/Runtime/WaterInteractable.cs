// WebGpuWater - marker for objects that interact with the water (Unity 6 / URP).
// Add this to any object that should disturb the surface - its Renderer may live on a
// CHILD (a boat keeps physics on a bare root with the visuals as children). It
// self-registers in a static list, so detection is automatic: no manual wiring, no
// per-frame Find.
//
// Two interaction modes, chosen on the WaterVolume (objectInteraction):
// - MouseLikeDrops (default): this component emits analytic cosine drops CLONED from
//   the mouse rules - one drop per fixed step of vertical plunge/rise, one wake drop
//   per fixed step of horizontal travel (the mouse drag's spacing rule). Smooth by
//   construction: no rasterization, and slow rotation emits nothing at all.
// - FootprintDelta: WaterObstacle rasterizes the submerged footprint top-down and the
//   sim injects the frame-to-frame delta (shaped wakes for large hulls).
